						A MODERN CLASSIC
					</h3>
					<p class="textstart">
						Since its first flight the A330 has been an example of a highly innovative aircraft that delivers superior quality and efficiency. As a member of Airbus’ widebody family the A330 benefits from a continuous investment of €150 million every year; integrating the latest developments from the A350 and A380 Aircraft Families to maintain its position as the best in its class, well ahead of its competition.
						<br>
						<br>
						With the arrival of the new engine option (NEO) the A330 Family continues to go from strength to strength. Technological advances in modern engines and wing design further enhance the performance of this aircraft; delivering savings on fuel burn whilst simultaneously helping the environment.

						FLY WITH A SMILE ON YOUR FACE
					</h3>
					<p class="textstart">
						The A330 Family continues Airbus’ commitment to creating the most comfortable cabin for passengers and crew. Everyone flying on an A330 will be able to enjoy the extra personal space thanks to the widebody cabin and 18” wide seats while state-of-the-art ambient lighting creates a welcoming environment; enriching the feeling of luxury throughout the aircraft. Personalised in-flight entertainment options offer an array of choices and now full cabin connectivity allows passengers to stay in touch with the world below; whether it’s catching up on important emails or simply keeping social networks up to date. The A330neo is also the launch model for Airbus’ new Airspace cabin interiors making it the perfect example of the continuous efforts to take comfort to the next level.
						<br>
						<br>
						It’s not just passengers who benefit from the Airbus’ innovations in comfort and design. Cabin crew can enjoy their work in an environment that has been optimised to make doing their job as enjoyable as possible; state-of-the-art galleys allow the easy preparation and service of in-flight meals and comfortable crew rest areas ensure that all staff will be refreshed, creating the best possible environment to look after passengers.

					<h3 class="start">
						FLEXIBLE AND RELIABLE
					</h3>
					<p class="textstart">
						Capable of flying efficiently routes from 30 minutes to over 15 hours the A330 is a highly efficient aircraft. It seamlessly complements the A350 XWB offering a similar passenger experience and thanks to the Common Type Rating, pilots can be trained to fly both aircraft with minimum fuss. Boasting an operational reliability of 99.4% this is an aircraft that consistently delivers. Wherever you might be going, this is the aircraft that can get you there, on time and in the most comfortable way possible.
