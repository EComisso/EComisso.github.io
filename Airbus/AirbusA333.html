						GETTING BETTER YEAR ON YEAR				
					</h3>
					<p class="textstart">
						Airbus invests 150 million euros annually in the A330 programme to deliver continuous innovation to this jetliner product line that result in lower costs and better operations for the A330-300. Like all Airbus aircraft it utilises the digital fly-by-wire but also incorporates several new features. These upgrades range from weight reductions in the airframe, introduction of modern passenger cabin features, and system improvements to engine upgrades and advanced navigation systems in the cockpit.  They also result in longer maintenance check intervals.
						<br>
						<br>
						A further enhancement of the A330 comes with Airbus’ launch of an increased maximum takeoff weight capability to 242 metric tonnes.  With this improvement, the A330-300 benefits from up to 500 nautical miles of extra range, to 6,350 nautical miles (11,750 km.) – with 277 passengers, and carries nearly five tonnes more payload than the previous 235-tonne aircraft.  In operational terms, the increased takeoff weight A330-300 is able to connect to the following new city pairs: London to Tokyo; Frankfurt to Cape Town; Beijing to Melbourne; Beijing to San Francisco; Kuala Lumpur to Paris; and Los Angeles to Dublin.
