						A350-900 – REDEFINING COMFORT			
					</h3>
					<p class="textstart">
						Like all members of the A350 XWB Family the A350-900 benefits from having the most modern cabin; delivering new standards of comfort to passengers throughout the flight. The advances made in the creation of the A350 XWB’s cabin has led to the development of Airspace by Airbus concept which will deliver the perfect space for passenger well-being, exemplified by the A350 XWB, to the rest of Airbus’ aircraft families.
						<br>
						<br>  
						Passengers on the A350-900 can look forward to a spacious elegantly lit cabin as they settle into Airbus’ wider seats for an enjoyable flight. The quietness of the cabin contributes to a relaxing environment, whilst the very latest in-flight entertainment allows passengers to access movies on demand or stay-up-to-date with the world below with Wi-Fi and mobile phone connectivity; whether it’s staying up-to-date with social media or replying to important business emails.

						INNOVATION THAT MAKES AN IMPACT		
					</h3>
					<p class="textstart">
						Incorporating advances in flight controls, systems and wing design the A350-800 is a truly state-of-the-art aircraft. These developments have a genuine impact in terms of safety, maintenance and efficiency meaning that the aircraft reduces its fuel burn significantly – generating savings and reducing its environmental impact.
						<br>
						<br> 
						As with all A350 XWB models the fuselage is built with carbon-fibre reinforce plastic (CFRP) – supportsing lower fuel burn, easier maintenance and increased resistance to corrosion. Simultaneously, the jetliner’s wings are more efficient and quieter due to their advanced design, and are able to adapt while airborne – tailoring it for maximum aerodynamic efficiency in the various phases of flight.

					<h3 class="start">
						GOING THE ‘XTRA’ DISTANCE			
					</h3>
					<p class="textstart">
						As part of its philosophy for continuous innovation, Airbus has launched the Ultra-Long Range version of the A350-900. Designated as the A350-900ULR, the jetliner offers increased fuel-carrying capacity of up to 165,000 litres and a higher 280-tonne maximum takeoff weight to enable service on non-stop flights of up to 19 hours.
						<br>
						<br> 
						Benefitting from the A350 XWB’s unique flexibility, the extended range capability does not involve installation of additional fuel tanks (just an adaptation of the fuel system within the existing fuel tank), and the A350-900ULR can be reconfigured to the standard long-haul specifications if required by the operator. 
					</p>
					<hr>
					<h3 class="start">	
						New-generation design		
					</h3>
					<p class="textstart">
						The A350 XWB has an entirely-new, uncompromised, 21st century design with a wider and taller fuselage for extra space and enhanced passenger comfort. Three A350 XWB models are available – with the A350-900 offering a typical passenger capacity of 325 seats, as well as an operating range of 8,100 nautical miles. 
						<br>
						<br>  
						The A350-900 is the cornerstone member of Airbus’ all-new A350 XWB Family, which is shaping the future of medium, long and ultra-long haul travel. This jetliner accommodates 325 passengers in a standard three-class configuration and its state-of-the-art comfort and amenities ensure that everyone on-board has a pleasant flight.
