						A NATURAL REVOLUTION IN DESIGN
					</h3>
					<p class="textstart">
						The most perfect designs are often found in nature. That’s why Airbus looks to learn from the natural world when designing and improving its aircraft. As the newest member of Airbus’ widebody family, the A350 XWB is an example of how this inspirational blend of science and nature represents another significant evolution in the ongoing mission to conceive and manufacture the perfect aircraft. Whether it’s the revolutionary adaptive wing design, inspired by birds, which morphs while airborne to achieve maximum aerodynamic efficiency throughout the flight or the efficiency savings generated by innovative technological advances this aircraft has learned from nature to help ensure a healthy future for the planet.
						<br>
						<br>
						Designed with both passengers and airlines at heart, it benefits from being built with over 70% cutting-edge materials; combining carbon composites (53%), titanium and advanced aluminium alloys, to create a lighter and more cost-efficient aircraft.  Its latest generation engines are quieter and more efficient.
						<br>
						<br>
						The combination of these advantages result in 25% lower operating costs, fuel burn and C02 emissions when compared with previous generation aircraft; showing Airbus’ commitment to protecting the environment whilst remaining truly at the cutting edge of air travel.

						AIRSPACE: A NEW STANDARD OF COMFORT
					</h3>
					<p class="textstart">
						It’s not only the technology that has been revolutionised. When Airbus designed the A350 XWB a cabin was created that is so comfortable that it revolutionised the approach to all Airbus aircraft interiors. As the founding member of the Airspace by Airbus cabin family, passengers on the A350 XWB can experience a feeling of on-board comfort like never before. The aircraft’s innovative design delivers a feeling of spaciousness wherever you look; with wider seats, high ceilings and alluring ambient lighting. Airbus has produced the perfect environment in which to enjoy flying and arrive at destination after a long haul flight feeling in a much better shape. 
						<br>
						<br>
						The A350 XWBs cabin is also the quietest on a twin-aisle aircraft and its advanced technology delivers the highest possible air quality with optimised cabin altitude (6000ft), temperature and humidity, with the air being renewed every 2 to 3 minutes. Passengers can breathe easily knowing that Airbus have thought of everything to ensure that they can arrive feeling fresh.
						<br>
						<br>
						Long journeys will pass quickly with the latest generation inflight experience. Integrated connectivity lets passengers stay in touch with the rest of the world, while smart galleys and comfortable crew rest areas provide cabin crew with a pleasant working environment making it even easier to look after passengers.

						THE SMART CHOICE FOR ANY AIRLINE
					</h3>
					<p class="textstart">
						It’s no surprise that this brilliantly designed aircraft is one of the most versatile in the sky. The A350 WXB flies long ranges up to 8,100 nautical miles but with full operational flexibility it can be easily configured to operate both Regional and Ultra-Long-Range routes (8700nm).
						<br>
						<br>
						The A350 XWB also perfectly complements the A330 Family offering significant advantages to airlines operating both aircraft. Whether it is in terms of route planning or the reduced training time for pilots familiar with A330 (thanks to the common type rating), the seamless integration of the two families is highly economical and proves the value of the A350 XWBs innovative design.

						Inspired by birds, the A350 
						<br>
						XWB’s wings have been designed 
						<br>
						to adapt during flight, morphing 
						<br>
						while airborne and changing 
						<br>

						aircraft to “wear sunglasses,”

					<p class="A350infostart">
						The overall wing area of Airbus’ 
						<br>
						A350 XWB covers more space than 
						<br>
