						A350-1000 – A NEW STANDARD OF COMFORT			
					</h3>
					<p class="textstart">
						The A350 XWB Family cabin design proved to be so successful that it redefined Airbus’ approach to cabin interiors – leading to the creation of Airspace by Airbus, a next-generation cabin concept inspired by four key attributes: comfort, service, ambience and design. 
						<br>
						<br>
						Passengers on the A350-1000 can expect a spacious and quiet cabin, wider seats and elegant ambient lighting that not only contributes to a beautiful interior, but minimises the effects of jetlag, as well. The A350-1000 also can offer passengers the most modern in-flight experience available.
						<br>
						<br> 
						With movies on-demand included within a range of features passengers can stay entertained throughout their flight, while the availability of email and Wi-Fi connectivity can ensure that they can stay in touch with the world below; whether it’s posting to social networks, staying on top of important business emails or something else – there’s no need to be out of touch when you’re in the air.

					<h3 class="start">
						INNOVATION		
					</h3>
					<p class="textstart">
						The A350 XWB is truly innovative; introducing new technology throughout the entirety of the aircraft. From the design of the wings that morph and change shape in-flight to obtain optimal efficiency, to the flight controls and system that reduce the pilot’s workload, this aircraft utilizes modern technology to create a better way of flying.
						<br>
						<br>
						Nowhere is this innovation more apparent than in the A350 XWB’s fuselage, built with carbon-fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP). The combination of these technological advances ensures that the A350-1000 burns 25 per cent less fuel than its nearest competitor, saving money and reducing any harmful effects to the environment.			
					</p>
					<hr>
					<h3 class="start">
						INCREASED EFFICIENCY		
					</h3>
					<p class="textstart">
						Powering the A350-1000 will be higher-thrust Trent XWB engines from manufacturer Rolls-Royce, which will allow the largest member of the A350 XWB Family to attain even greater levels of efficiency.
						<br>
						<br> 
						The engine will provide additional payload capability and range, along with 97,000 lbs. of thrust on take-off – making it the most powerful engine ever developed for an Airbus aircraft.  With these specially-tailored Trent XWB powerplants, the A350-1000 will be capable of supporting long-haul routes to emerging markets such as Shanghai-Boston or Paris-Santiago, as well as more traditional flight segments as Manchester-Los Angeles or Dubai-Melbourne.			
					</p>
					<hr>
					<h3 class="start">
						High performance		
					</h3>
					<p class="textstart">
						Designed with airlines' priorities in mind, the A350 XWB meets the multiple challenges of high fuel prices, rising expectations from passengers and increasing environmental concerns.
						<br>
						<br>  
						As with the other A350 XWB Family members, Airbus’ A350-1000 brings together the very latest in aerodynamics, design and advanced technologies for a 25 per cent step change in fuel efficiency compared to its current long-range competitor.
						<br>
						<br>
						Measuring nearly 74 metres from nose-to-tail, the A350-1000 – scheduled to enter service in 2017 – is the longest-fuselage version of Airbus’ all-new family of twin-aisle, widebody jetliners. In a typical three-class configuration, featuring the company’s 18-inch-wide economy class seats for modern comfort, the A350-1000 seats a total of 366 passengers.
