						HELPING THE WORLD MOVE

						The A320 is one aircraft in four sizes (A318, A319, A320 and A321) meaning it is the most successful and versatile aircraft family ever. Seating from 100 to 200 passengers and flying everywhere in the world, on every continent; an A320 takes off or lands every 2 seconds.
						From the heat of the desert to icy Arctic runways or from short runway urban environments to remote high-altitude airports there’s nowhere that it can’t take you. As the longest range 
						single-aisle aircraft, since its introduction airlines and passengers alike have benefitted from this aircraft’s exceptional efficiency and quality which has opened up exciting new travel 
						possibilities throughout the world. Now with new engine options (NEO) available the A320 Family
						continues to be the preferred choice for passengers and customers; setting the standard for the single-aisle market and securing its status as the world’s best-selling aircraft of all time.
						This is an aircraft that you can rely on. This is the aircraft that changed the game.

						IT'S THE BEST FOR A REASON
					</h3>
					<p class="textstart">
						The A320 Family is the most successful aircraft family ever and it was born ambitious. As the first civil aircraft to pioneer fly-by-wire technology, it has set the standard ever since its arrival and, thanks to significant annual investment of 300 million euros, continues to innovate. The A320neos boast the very latest engines, large wing tip devices (Sharklets) and an innovative cabin and continue to go from strength to strength as the most comfortable, fuel efficient and environmentally friendly single-aisle aircraft.
