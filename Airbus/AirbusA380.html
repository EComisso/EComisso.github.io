						AN EXPERIENCE YOU WILL REMEMBER EVERY TIME YOU FLY
					</h3>
					<p class="textstart">
						There is no other aircraft in the world like it and no other travelling experience comes close. The A380 is a modern icon that over 120 million passengers have already fallen in love with.
						<br>
						<br>
						Flying with the A380 is a unique experience that introduces you to new standards of in-flight comfort, from first class to economy. As the world’s biggest and most spacious passenger aircraft, its cabin allows passengers to stretch out in the widest seats in a calm and relaxing environment. With the unparalleled freedom it gives passengers to move it’s no surprise that the A380 is the preferred choice in all cabin classes.
						<br>
						<br>
						The double-deck A380 is truly a marvel of science and engineering; it makes excellent use of its space to offer passengers attainable luxury. With enough room to install stylish first class suites, eye-catching bar or business areas, beautifully inviting cabin lighting and the quietest cabin in the sky you’ll enjoy every aspect of your flight and, thanks to innovative cabin air supply technology, you’ll arrive feeling inspired and ready to go.

						THE FUTURE OF LONG-RANGE AIR TRAVEL
					</h3>
					<p class="textstart">
						With air traffic continuing to double every 15 years with the A380 Airbus have designed the perfect aircraft to meet the needs of the passengers of today and tomorrow whilst also delivering the level of efficiency necessary to protect the environment for future generations. With airport congestion more of an issue than ever, nine out of ten long distance passengers pass through 47 cities, 80% of which are already congested. 
						<br>
						<br>
						The A380 has two full-length decks with widebody dimensions meaning its two passenger levels offer an entire deck’s worth of additional space than the largest twin-engine aircraft. With more seats than any other aircraft the A380 offers solutions to overcrowding; needing less journeys to carry similar numbers of passengers. This is the best plane to alleviate congestion and optimise fleet plans. Protecting our planet and ensuring we will continue to have a world full of beautiful places to visit in the future.

						AN AIRCRAFT, NOT AN AIRPLANE (THE A380 EXPERIENCE)
					</h3>
					<p class="textstart">
						Combining the most advanced aviation technology and an inspired cabin design Airbus are proud to have created an aircraft that is celebrated for its outstanding quality in every aspect. Leading the industry in standards for innovation, experience and efficiency it is adored by passengers, pilots and crew.  It is a pleasure both to fly and be flown on and people who have experienced the A380 have said they would make a special effort way to fly on one again.
