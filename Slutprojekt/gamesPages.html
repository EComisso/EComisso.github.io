            	<h2>Assassin's Creed</h2>
                <p>
                	Assassin's Creed is a 2007 action-adventure stealth video game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft. It is the first major installment in the Assassin's Creed series. The game was first released on the Xbox 360 and later released to the PlayStation 3 in November 2007, and was later made available on Microsoft Windows in April 2008.
                </p>
                <p>
                	The plot is set in a fictional history of real world events and follows the centuries-old struggle between the Assassins, who fight for peace with free will, and the Templars, who desire peace through control. The game primarily takes place during the Third Crusade in the Holy Land in 1191, with the plot revolving around the Secret Order of Assassins, based upon the Hashshashin sect. The player is in reality playing as a modern-day man named Desmond Miles, who, through the use of a machine named the "Animus," is allowed the viewing and controlling of the protagonist's genetic memories of his ancestors, in this case, Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad, a member of the Assassins.

            	<h2>Gameplay</h2>
                <p>
                	Through this plot device, details emerge of a struggle between two factions, the Knights Templar and the Assassins, over an artifact known as a "Piece of Eden," an ancient artifact used to control minds. The game received generally positive reviews, with critics praising its storytelling, visuals, art design and originality, although the game was also criticized for the repetitive nature of its gameplay. Assassin's Creed won several awards at E3 in 2006, as well as several end-year awards after its release. The game spawned a sequel, Assassin's Creed II, which was released in November 2009. Since the release and success of Assassin's Creed II, subsequent releases were yearly until 2016 - with various other Assassins and time periods.
