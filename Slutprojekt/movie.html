                    The film is set in the same universe as the video games but features an original story that expands the series' mythology, taking place during the Spanish Inquisition. Filming began in late August 2015 and concluded in January 2016.

                <h2>Connections to the video games</h2>
                <p>
                    Aymar Azaïzia, head of Assassin's Creed content at Ubisoft, stated that the film, which is "a brand new story, with new characters set in our universe," had the possibility to feature "some familiar faces," and that the present day element would feature Abstergo. Fassbender said, "We really want to respect the game and the elements to it. But we also wanted to come up with our own thing. And one thing I’ve sort of learned from doing the franchises like X-Men is that audiences, I think, want to be surprised and to see new elements of what they already know, and different takes on it." The Animus, the machine used to experience ancestors' memories, was redesigned for the film, from a chair, to a machine that lifts the user in the air, allowing for a more modern, interactive and dramatic experience. Fassbender also noted the change was made to avoid comparisons to The Matrix. The Abstergo compound in the film features an artifact room that holds specific weapons from the games beyond the traditional Assassin wrist blades, including: Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad's sword (Assassin's Creed); Connor/Ratonhnhaké:ton's bow (Assassin's Creed III); Edward Kenway's flintlock pistols (Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag); and the cane sword of the twins Jacob and Evie Frye (Assassin's Creed Syndicate). Fassbender also stated that Ubisoft was "very keen" about elements being created for the film, and were considering incorporating them into future games.
